"""
remove_irrelavant_classes.py

Removes unwanted classes from a COCO annotation file.

Functionality:
- Deletes annotations whose categories are not in a keep-list.
- Updates the categories section accordingly.
- Saves the cleaned annotation JSON.

Recommended before model training if some defect types are irrelevant.
